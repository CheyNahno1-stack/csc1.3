# csc1.3
Overview
In this assignment, you will work with exceptions and loops.

Guidelines
At a minimum, you need to include 2 different exceptions and 1 loop. You can pick the theme of your choice, or you can use a theme of a program that displays a simulated error log that uses a while loop to update in "real-time" when a button is clicked. Create a ListBox that shows the date and time and some details of the made-up exception.

Expectations
Create/handle 2 different exceptions.
Use 1 for or while loop.
Over-comment the code to show your understanding of the code and the intent of your application.
Name your variables using best naming practices.
Make improvements to your UI. Your application must have a great UX and provide the user with more than enough information they will need to use your application without help.
Deliverables / Submission 
Video of your work demonstrating all functionality of this assignment.
Submit the zipped project folders and files and include the solution to GitHub.
Projects that significantly exceed the requirements will need prior approval from the instructor and may require a code review to receive credit.
